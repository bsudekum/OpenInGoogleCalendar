This extension is designed for privacy and transparency:

The extension underlines dates on webpages and allows you to quickly create Google Calendar events from those dates.

No personal data is collected or transmitted.

All processing of page content, metadata, and user actions happens locally in your browser.

The extension does not track your browsing history, record any keystrokes, or store any private data beyond user preferences (such as options settings), which are kept on your device.

The source URL is included in event details only when you choose to create an event, and this information is sent to Google Calendar as part of the event creation deeplink.

The extension does not communicate with any servers operated by the developer or by third parties, except for opening google.com/calendar when creating an event.

You can uninstall the extension at any time to remove all functionality.
